**Data-izing the penal code**

# Just gimme the data

Check out the /output/ folder in this repo.

Here are the files and their sources:

All data came from here:https://cga.ct.gov/2015/rpt/2015-R-0046.htm

* misdemenor-examples.csv

# The scraper

See the *.py files: go.py and grab.py

use python go.py to scrape it yourself.

# TODOs

* I'd like to clean up the minimum sentence column and create a related table
containing the values. Don't need it for current project though.
